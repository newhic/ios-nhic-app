# New Hope International iOS App README#

This README documents steps needed to get the app running

### Xcode ###

To develop iOS apps, you will first need a system running Mac OS. While any Mac released after 2009 will do the job, 8 GB of ram would be the recommended minimum memory. From experience, just having Xcode and a iOS emulator running at the same time uses about 4 GB of RAM on a 8 GB system. On a 4 GB system, Mac OS throttles it to only use about 3 GB. The more RAM the better. Having the latest Mac OS is not a requirement. 

Download Xcode from the App Store and update it as necessary. 

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Open up Xcode.
2. Select "check out an existing project".
3. Enter the following for repository location: https://your-username@bitbucket.org/apps4christ/nhic-ios-app.git.
4. Choose the master branch when prompted.
5. Navigate to, or create the directory in which you want to clone the project, and press the Check Out button.

You will then pull the latest development version of the NHIC iOS app. Hit the run button and verify that you are able to successfully emulate the app. You will not be able to test on any physical devices unless you register as a developer with Apple. It is a yearly registration costing $100. The iOS emulator is pretty accurate and lets you simulate most scenarios, so don't worry about not being able to test on an actual physical device. If you would like to, talk with Mark Merin and he can load your latest changes on a test device.
