# NHIC iOS App #

This README documents steps needed to get the app running

### How do I get set up? ###

To develop iOS apps, you will first need a Mac. I would recommend at least any Mac released after 2009. However for optimum performance, I would have at least 8 GB of RAM installed. In my experience, just having Xcode and a iOS emulator running at the same time uses about 4 GB of RAM on a 8 GB system. On a 4 GB system, Mac OS throttles it to only use about 3 GB. The more RAM the better. Having the latest Mac OS is not a requirement. 

Download Xcode from the App Store and update it as necessary. 

Select check out a project from source control and when prompted put in the following as the source

You will then pull the latest development version of the NHIC iOS app. Hit the run button and verify that you are able to successfully emulate the app. You will not be able to test on any physical devices unless you register as a developer with Apple. It is a yearly registration costing $100. The iOS emulator is pretty accurate and lets you simulate most scenarios, so don't worry about not being able to test on an actual physical device. If you would like to, talk with Mark Merin and he can load your latest changes on a test device.
